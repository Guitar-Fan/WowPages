# VS Code Zero - Project Outline

## Architecture Overview
A complete offline Progressive Web App that replicates VS Code core features using:
- Monaco Editor for the editing experience
- WebAssembly for C++ compilation and language services
- OPFS (Origin Private File System) for persistent file storage
- Service Workers for offline functionality
- Web APIs for terminal emulation and Git integration

## Core Components

### 1. Editor Core (Monaco Editor)
- Full VS Code UI layout with sidebar, status bar, minimap
- Syntax highlighting for C++, Python, JS, HTML, Markdown
- IntelliSense, hover, go-to-definition, refactoring
- Multi-cursor support, code folding, themes
- Keybindings (Ctrl+S, Ctrl+/, etc.)

### 2. File System Management
- OPFS as primary file system for performance
- IndexedDB fallback for compatibility
- File explorer tree with CRUD operations
- Multi-root workspace support
- Drag and drop file management

### 3. C++ Development Environment
- Clang/LLVM compiled to WebAssembly
- Real-time compilation and execution
- Integrated terminal for program output
- Debugging support with breakpoints
- Standard library integration

### 4. Terminal Emulator
- xterm.js for full terminal experience
- Virtual file system commands (ls, cd, cat, etc.)
- Execute compiled WASM binaries
- Multiple terminal tabs support

### 5. Git Integration
- isomorphic-git for offline Git operations
- Clone, commit, branch, diff, status
- Visual Git interface in sidebar
- Works offline after initial clone

### 6. PWA Features
- Service worker for complete offline functionality
- Manifest for Chrome installation
- Auto-update when online
- Persistent storage and caching

## Technical Implementation
- All dependencies bundled locally (no CDN after first load)
- WebAssembly modules for performance-critical operations
- Modern ES6+ modules with dynamic imports
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Optimized loading and caching strategies
